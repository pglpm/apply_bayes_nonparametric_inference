• the values of the parameters are given by cluster number first. For
  example for a matrix (a11,a21,a12,a22) they are given as

a11(1st cluster) a11(2nd cluster) a11(3rd cluster) ... a21(1st cluster) ...

this corresponds to joining the parameters into an array:

array(c(par_clus_1, par_clus_2, par_clus3, ...), c(..dims_params.., nClusters))

from which the parameters can be obtained as




• covariance matrices are probably given by column

• – psi: cluster weights (eqn 2)
  – phi: probabilities of categories (eqn 11)
  – mu: normal means
  – Sigma: normal covariances
  – nClusters: number of clusters
  
  – alpha: DP concentration
  – mu00: normal hyperprior mean
  – Sigma00: normal hyperprior covariance
  – kappa1: invWishart hyperprior parameter
  – R1: invWishart hyperprior matrix

– 'sig' in clusterParameters is the covariance matrix.

– 'PriorDraw(mdobj,n)' gives n draws from the distribution mdobj. In the
  mvn case in gives n pairs (mu, sigma) drawn from the normal-Wishart
  distribution.

– 'PosteriorClusters' gives several pairs (mu,sigma) drawn from the base
  distribution together with the additional atomic measures. In the mvn
  case it is the normal-Wishart summed with atomic measures on the
  (mu,sigma) of the clusters under consideration.

– A draw from the Dirichlet process can be seen as a discrete distribution,
  but also as a set of parameters.


– res_idnew101 is good to show deceiving prior that leads to good results

– con 15 dim:
ka <- 10/1

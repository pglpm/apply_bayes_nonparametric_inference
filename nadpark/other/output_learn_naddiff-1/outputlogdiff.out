Starting Monte Carlo sampling of 3600 samples by 60 chains
in a space of 959 (effectively 7047) dimensions.
Using 12 cores: 60 samples per chain, 5 chains per core.
Core logs are being saved in individual files.

C-compiling samplers appropriate to the variates (package Nimble)
this can take tens of minutes with many data or variates.

Starting Monte Carlo sampling of 3648 samples by 64 chains
in a space of 1727 (effectively 17667) dimensions.
Using 8 cores: 57 samples per chain, 8 chains per core.
Core logs are being saved in individual files.

C-compiling samplers appropriate to the variates (package Nimble)
this can take tens of minutes with many data or variates.

Starting Monte Carlo sampling of 3600 samples by 60 chains
in a space of 1727 (effectively 53511) dimensions.
Using 2 cores: 60 samples per chain, 30 chains per core.
Core logs are being saved in individual files.

C-compiling samplers appropriate to the variates (package Nimble)
this can take tens of minutes with many data or variates.
